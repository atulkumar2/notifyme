## Why These Reminders Matter

### 👁️ Blink Reminders

When staring at screens, people blink 66% less, causing **digital eye strain**, dry eyes, and fatigue. Regular blinking refreshes eyes with natural tears and reduces strain.

### 🚶 Walking Reminders

Sitting for extended periods restricts blood flow, weakens muscles, and increases health risks. Even brief 5-minute walking breaks improve circulation, mood, and productivity by up to 30%.

### 💧 Hydration Reminders

Even mild dehydration (2%) impairs concentration, memory, and decision-making. Your brain is 75% water! Regular hydration maintains optimal body function and energy levels.
