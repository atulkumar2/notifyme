## Why These Reminders Matter

### 👁️ Eye Blink Reminders - Prevent Digital Eye Strain

**The Problem:** Screen work reduces blinking by 66%, causing:

- Reduced tear production → dry, uncomfortable eyes
- Continuous eye muscle focus → fatigue and strain
- Long-term vision degradation and eye health issues

**The Solution:** Regular blinking refreshes eyes with natural tears and prevents strain. Ophthalmologists recommend the **20-20-20 rule**: every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

### 🚶 Walking Reminders - Combat Sedentary Health Risks

**The Problem:** Prolonged sitting causes:

- Restricted blood flow → increased heart disease and clot risks
- Muscle weakness and metabolic slowdown
- Postural problems → back and neck pain
- Mental health impact: reduced mood and increased stress

**The Solution:** Even 5-minute movement breaks:

- Improve blood circulation and strengthen muscles
- Enhance posture and reduce pain
- Boost mood, energy, and mental clarity
- Can reduce health risks by up to **30%**

### 💧 Hydration Reminders - Maintain Cognitive Function

**The Problem:** Even 2% dehydration impairs:

- Brain concentration and memory (brain is 75% water)
- Physical performance and energy levels
- Causes workplace headaches and fatigue
- Affects kidney function and digestion

**The Solution:** Regular water intake:

- Maintains optimal brain function and focus
- Improves energy and prevents headaches
- Supports overall health and wellbeing
- Recommended: 8-10 glasses daily
