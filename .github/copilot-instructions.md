# Copilot Instructions

- Run all terminal commands from the project home directory (the workspace root).
- Prefer editing files using apply_patch instead of terminal commands.
- Avoid reformatting unrelated code; keep changes minimal and focused.
- Update or add tests when changing behavior.
- Run linter checks or fix lint issues introduced by changes.
- Keep README in sync with user-facing changes.
- Use existing dependencies when possible; only add new ones if necessary.
